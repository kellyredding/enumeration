      # map enumeration
      enum :stuff, {
        :a => "aye",
        :b => "bee",
        :c => "see"
      }
    end

    # get the enum sets
    Thing.word_set      # => ['aye', 'bee', 'see']
    Thing.stuff_set     # => [:a, :b, :c]

    # lookup mapped enum values
    Thing.stuff(:a)     # => "aye"


    t = Thing.new

    # write list enum values
    t.word              # => nil
    t.word = "aye"
    t.word              # => "aye"
    t.word_key          # => "aye" (a list's 'keys' are it's values, vice-versa)
    t.word = "dee"
    t.word              # => nil  (won't write non enum values)
    t.word_key          # => nil

    # write mapped enum value
    t.stuff             # => nil
    t.stuff = :b        #    (write using key)
    t.stuff             # => "bee"
    t.stuff_key         # => :b
    t.stuff = "see"     #    (write using value)
    t.stuff             # => "see"
    t.stuff_key         # => :c
    t.stuff = :d
    t.stuff             # => nil (won't write non enum keys)
    t.stuff_key         # => nil
    t.stuff = "dee"
    t.stuff             # => nil (won't write non enum values)
    t.stuff_key         # => nil
